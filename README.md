## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an accountant by trade, working for top companies in the UK for the past 5 years.
Responsible for meeting business needs from a financial perspective.
In which, i had to constantly and continously liase with stakeholders to provide
the truest and fairest financials in order to drive business decisions.

As my career progressed, I realised where my deep passion is rooted within.

The duality of life experiences and anticipacting outcomes based on said experiences is innately human.
We use experiences in the past to better predict what to do for our own future.

Now say, we expedite the process of coming to a more accurate solution,
by eliminating noise, focusing on just the experiences, that matters for our own goals.

Then we are now talking about Data Science.

Elimiating noise would be equivalent to cleaning and preparation of data.
In turn, using the right data and statisical methods would lead to a better predictor of the future,
and retrospectively, the past.

This. This is where my passion lies.
